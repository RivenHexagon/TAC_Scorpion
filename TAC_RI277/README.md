# Total Audio Concepts (TAC) Scorpion Mixing Console Overhaul
## PCB RI277

Redesign of the Input Connector Card (PCB RI277) in order to populate it
with gold plated Audio Jacks. I made 6 of them fit a copper plated Eurocard
(100 mm x 80 mm) substrate for DIY etching.

## Made With

I named the new version RI277D and made them with KiCad 5.1.7. using a git
submodule that handles any special footprints:

## Further Modifications

The XLR Bus Out connectors were panel mounted and solder wired to the PCB as
well as the Tape Return wiring harness. I've provided two 3-pin Molex connectors
instead.
